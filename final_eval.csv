This is accomplished by the action of hair cells in the inner ear known as vestibular hair cells. These hair cells are arranged in a cone-shaped structure called the semicircular canals of the inner ear. The shape of the semicircular canals depends on the animal that has them, but is most easily discerned by the fact that there is a ring of cartilage at the back of the ear just in front of the auditory meatus. This ring is made up of two types of hair cells, each of which has a slightly different shape. One type of hair cell is round in shape, while the other is cylindrical. As an animal moves its head, the sound waves it gives off are picked up by the round hair cells, which in turn pass the vibrations along to the cylindrical hair cells, which, in turn, make contact with the bone-like stapes.

<|endoftext|> The most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither,"{'0': ' feasible nor cost prohibitive. This is in contrast to the methods used to estimate intensities that rely on weather balloons (e.g., Barros-Duque et al. 1996) or satellite altimetry (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 1996); these methods suffer from a lack of data and, more importantly, do not allow for consideration of nonstationary factors such as sea surface salinity as well as wind shear that are important determinants of tropical cyclone intensity. Another advantage of the technique is that it is less affected by spatial autocorrelation, the so-called Lorenz-Fitzsimmons effect, which results from the clustering of closely spaced observations in time and space due to time lags in the meteorological data processing and data assimilation processes in the troposcale and mesoscale circulation models. This effect is less pronounced than the effect of long-wavelength dispersion in the intensity estimates of baroclinic and extratropical convective systems and can be reduced to insignificance by accounting for the fact that there are several timeslots in a 24-hour time series, each of which contributes to the sum of the time series at that time of observation. In addition,'}","{'0': "" feasible nor cost-effective. There are, however, limitations to the information contained in the MODIS-derived intensities, such as the time it takes to acquire data (e.g., 1.5 to 2 days depending on the type of cloud) and the difficulty in reconciling it with weather station-based monitoring [Tedesco et al., 2004]. This may be remedied by more rapid access to high-resolution satellite imagery that has been available since the mid-1990s but only recently made available to the public in a timely manner [Wagner et al., 2011]. It is worth noting that tropical cyclone intensity is the sum of wind speed and central pressure as well as a component of sea surface temperature (SST) at the time of the hurricane or typhoon and not an all-encompassing measure of a storm's energy production. For example, hurricanes have been shown to develop along subtropical gyres and asymptotically slow down with increasing SST [Spencer et al., 2001; Stouffer et al., 2007]. These are well-suited for convective-scale research due to their short lifetimes but not suited for modeling, in which energy production is determined by dynamical interaction at scales""}",q8

This article provides a chronology of the North Korean attack and an analysis of the circumstances that led to the loss of the SPH-60.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nAs tensions between the Koreas escalated in the summer of 2010, the North Korean People\'s Army (KPA) moved to establish a buffer zone that straddled the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries. At the same time, Kim Jong-il, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, issued a directive calling for the rearmament of the DPRK.[1] This was the first time in the post-Stalinist era that the military had been tasked with modernizing its weapons of war, and it raised concerns among South Korean and United Press International (UPI) correspondents who traveled to the North for the reporting that would be published in their August 5, 2010 issue. On August 5, two days after the incident, KCNA reported that the ""entire'}","{'0': "" city. These approaches consisted of Changgye Bridge, a two-tiered road (south and north) that bisected the city in an easterly direction, as well as Hwaecheon-dong, a single-tiered road (northeast and southwest) that traversed the North Korean-controlled part of the city. In all, there were at least two to three times as many people as could be accommodated on the city's southern and northern approaches, resulting in traffic jams for a couple of days. This is typical of Pyongyang's congested arterial and intermodal infrastructure.\n\nIt has been noted that the number of casualties and property damage were the biggest impediments to resuming dialogue between the Koreas. Pyongyang did not seem to take a hard line to any of the provocations and, thus, failed to demonstrate it was capable of deterring Pyongyang's belligerent and bellicose behavior. As a result, South Korea had to wait another 10 days before restarting high-level inter-Korean talks in mid-September.\n\nWhat's the bottom line? There is no silver bullet that can be put in place to deal with the Pyongyang-Pyongyang conundrum. But one thing is clear: A""}",q8

This is accomplished by the action of hair cells in the inner ear known as vestibular hair cells. These hair cells are arranged in a cone-shaped structure called the semicircular canals of the inner ear. The shape of the semicircular canals depends on the animal that has them, but is most easily discerned by the fact that there is a ring of cartilage at the back of the ear just in front of the auditory meatus. This ring is made up of two types of hair cells, each of which has a slightly different shape. One type of hair cell is round in shape, while the other is cylindrical. As an animal moves its head, the sound waves it gives off are picked up by the round hair cells, which in turn pass the vibrations along to the cylindrical hair cells, which, in turn, make contact with the bone-like stapes. Once the vibrations have passed through the stapes, they are reacclimated to the air by the hair'}","{'0': "" to the cochlea.\n\n\nIn order to be able to hear, the animal has to vibrate (acoustically) at a certain frequency that is inaudible to the human ear.

Another advantage of the technique is that it is less affected by spatial autocorrelation, the so-called Lorenz-Fitzsimmons effect, which results from the clustering of closely spaced observations in time and space due to time lags in the meteorological data processing and data assimilation processes in the troposcale and mesoscale circulation models. This effect is less pronounced than the effect of long-wavelength dispersion in the intensity estimates of baroclinic and extratropical convective systems and can be reduced to insignificance by accounting for the fact that there are several timeslots in a 24-hour time series, each of which contributes to the sum of the time series at that time of observation.

There are, however, limitations to the information that can be obtained from radar altimetry, such as the loss of tropospheric refraction due to the curvature of the earth (Fig. 1).\n\nRadar altimetry is based on the Doppler effect, which is the time it takes for a wave to change frequency from one frequency to another. In the case of thunderstorms, the change in frequency is caused by the updraft that is propagating at supersonic velocities over the cloud and, by concomitant pressure gradients, to a vertical wind shear, which acts to slow the wave back down to the base frequency. This can be quantified to an accuracy of less than 1 millisecond, as long as the instrument is in line with the direction of the radar beam. However, it is possible to make false detections and overestimate the intensities of tornadoes, for example, by as much as a factor of 2-3 on the Fujita scale and up to several magnitudes in the Flesch-Kincaid scale.

This, in turn, led to the decision to destroy the ship at the end of the Dominion War by detonating its warp core. After the crew and crew-mates of the Defiant were assimilated by the Jem\'Hadar, the ship was refitted with Borg technology and rechristened the USS Bellerophon.\n\nExternal link EditImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption More than one'}",q1

At the same time, Kim Jong-il, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, issued a directive calling for the rearmament of the DPRK.[1] This was the first time in the post-Stalinist era that the military had been tasked with modernizing its weapons of war, and it raised concerns among South Korean and United Press International (UPI) correspondents who traveled to the North for the reporting that would be published in their August 5, 2010 issue.

First, it is important to keep in mind that the Korean War was a stalemate at that time. Neither side had the upper hand militarily, and no one wanted to be the first to break the stalemate. As a result, all efforts were focused on finding a way to draw the war out to a point where victory was attainable. One of the ways this was accomplished was by attacking in the middle of the road, rather than at the flanks. By doing this, the North Koreans were able to make it more difficult for the South Koreans to counterattack and win the battle. Also, the North Koreans did not appear to be planning an amphibious assault like the U.S. had in Desert Storm. Rather, they had their artillery on the front lines and used this to devastating effect.

This is accomplished by the action of hair cells in the inner ear known as vestibular hair cells. These hair cells are arranged in a cone-shaped structure called the semicircular canals of the inner ear. The shape of the semicircular canals depends on the animal that has them, but is most easily discerned by the fact that there is a ring of cartilage at the back of the ear just in front of the auditory meatus. This ring is made up of two types of hair cells, each of which has a slightly different shape. One type of hair cell is round in shape, while the other is cylindrical. As an animal moves its head, the sound waves it gives off are picked up by the round hair cells, which in turn pass the vibrations along to the cylindrical hair cells, which, in turn, make contact with the bone-like stapes.

<|endoftext|> The Dvorak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by Vernon Dvorak ) is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes,"{'0': "" wind speed and rain/snow intensities ). The Dvorak technique relies on the difference between surface pressure and barometric pressure to estimate the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. This differs from the more well known Doppler technique in that the two are inextricably linked, i.e. there is no way to know for how long it will take for a storm to dissipate without being able to measure the pressure at the surface. In other words, you are looking at changes in pressure that are a function of time rather than an instantaneous change as can be seen in the image below (courtesy Weather Underground's Joe Bastardi, who was kind enough to share his work with WUWT.

In this post I am going to give a simple introduction to the Dvorak technique, which you can find on wikipedia and the NOAA Hurricane Forecast System (HFS) web site.\n\nWhat is the Dvorak technique?\n\nIt is based on the fact that there are two ways to describe the motion of a wave: it can be described as a sine wave or a Fourier transform. If you are familiar with wave theory then you will be familiar with the concept of wavelet, which is used to describe the frequency content of a wave. This wavelet representation gives you a number of information about the wave such as amplitude, phase, etc. However, it does not give you the direction of the wave (as in an ellipse). The reason for this is that you have to add an offset to the end of the wave to get the wave length. This can be approximated by taking the square root of the frequency and multiplying by 2, where x is the angle in radians. So for a sinusoidal wave with frequency ω = f/2'}",exp

<|endoftext|> The most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither,"{'0': ' feasible nor cost prohibitive. This is in contrast to the methods used to estimate intensities that rely on weather balloons (e.g., Barros-Duque et al. 1996) or satellite altimetry (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 1996); these methods suffer from a lack of data and, more importantly, do not allow for consideration of nonstationary factors such as sea surface salinity as well as wind shear that are important determinants of tropical cyclone intensity. Another advantage of the technique is that it is less affected by spatial autocorrelation, the so-called Lorenz-Fitzsimmons effect, which results from the clustering of closely spaced observations in time and space due to time lags in the meteorological data processing and data assimilation processes in the troposcale and mesoscale circulation models. This effect is less pronounced than the effect of long-wavelength dispersion in the intensity estimates of baroclinic and extratropical convective systems and can be reduced to insignificance by accounting for the fact that there are several timeslots in a 24-hour time series, each of which contributes to the sum of the time series at that time of observation. In addition,'}","{'0': ' feasible nor cost-effective. This is important because, as discussed in chapter 3, there is no evidence that tropical cyclones are intensifying, in any of the tropical basins of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nA further, more subtle benefit of the approach used in this study is that it can be used to provide an estimate of the number of days per year, on average, that a tropical cyclone of moderate intensity (category 1 or 2) will occur in a given area. For this purpose, we assume that the probability of an area being affected by a tropical cyclone is proportional to the square of the area in square miles. This assumption, however, is based on data that have been compiled over the past 50 years, and the results may not be valid for recent years. In the case of hurricanes, for example, it is well known that they have become more frequent in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of South America, as well as in the North Atlantic. This suggests that a change in the intensity threshold is taking place, which will result in increased occurrence of hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall in these areas. If this is the case, we should expect an increase in the number of days per year in which a tropical cyclone will occur'}",exp

There was nothing to do but sit in the sun, drink tea and play with the children. But that was no good at all, I was in a rut, my work stultifying me to the point of not wanting to be a human being any more.

Rauschenberg is known for his ""art for art\'s sake"" work, in which abstract expressionism takes precedence over reality. The same can be said of Hulme\'s Autumn and A City Sunset. They have no intention of making art, just painting in the light of their love. They do not have an artistic vision, but are driven by a desire to be with their beloved.

Armor evolved to be lighter, stronger, and more resistant to impact than metal, which in turn led to more efficient weapons and a greater number of battleships. In this article, we will take a close look at the evolution of armor and see how it was incorporated into the design of ships and their armament.\n\nEarly Iron and the Invention of Armor\n\nBefore iron could be mined, it had to be smelted. The most common way to do this was to heat iron to high temperatures, called tempering, and let it cool in a crucible. This is a slow process, taking several days, and it left a residue of impurities that could be washed away. To avoid this, early manufacturers created molds that were hollow and filled with clay. These mold-filled cavities, called blanks, were placed in an iron mold, where they could be heated and shaped into armor. The first armor-plated ship'}",exp

This ring is made up of two types of hair cells, each of which has a slightly different shape. One type of hair cell is round in shape, while the other is cylindrical.

<|endoftext|> The Dvorak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by Vernon Dvorak ) is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes,"{'0': "" wind speed and rain/snow intensities ). The Dvorak technique relies on the difference between surface pressure and barometric pressure to estimate the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. This differs from the more well known Doppler technique in that the two are inextricably linked, i.e. there is no way to know for how long it will take for a storm to dissipate without being able to measure the pressure at the surface. In other words, you are looking at changes in pressure that are a function of time rather than an instantaneous change as can be seen in the image below (courtesy Weather Underground's Joe Bastardi, who was kind enough to share his work with WUWT.

One of the most well-known poets of the 20th century, Robert Penn Warren had a profound influence on the generation of Objectivists that followed his death in 1971.\n\n\nThis is the first in a series of articles that seeks to answer the question: What was the influence of William S.

(Click here to read part one in its entirety.)\n\nI\'m going to start by saying that there are a lot of similarities between Burroughs and Dos Passos, not the least of which is the author-poet relationship. Both were self-styled ""outsiders"" from the New York literary establishment, which was in thrall to the decadent art deco aesthetic of the Roaring Twenties and thirties. As an outsider, Burroughs felt the need to break free of the shackles of convention and create his own brand of art, something that has been the calling card of many of his work to this day. This call to independence in no way detracts from'}"," Pound and Williams. The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse. Clearly linking Objectivism's principles with Imagism's, Louis Zukofsky insisted, in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry, on writing "" which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking with the things as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody.""",q2

<|endoftext|> The most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither,"{'0': ' feasible nor cost prohibitive. This is in contrast to the methods used to estimate intensities that rely on weather balloons (e.g., Barros-Duque et al. 1996) or satellite altimetry (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 1996); these methods suffer from a lack of data and, more importantly, do not allow for consideration of nonstationary factors such as sea surface salinity as well as wind shear that are important determinants of tropical cyclone intensity. Another advantage of the technique is that it is less affected by spatial autocorrelation, the so-called Lorenz-Fitzsimmons effect, which results from the clustering of closely spaced observations in time and space due to time lags in the meteorological data processing and data assimilation processes in the troposcale and mesoscale circulation models. This effect is less pronounced than the effect of long-wavelength dispersion in the intensity estimates of baroclinic and extratropical convective systems and can be reduced to insignificance by accounting for the fact that there are several timeslots in a 24-hour time series, each of which contributes to the sum of the time series at that time of observation.

The Royal Navy and United States Navy were the first navies to build aircraft carriers, in the latter case under the auspices of the Admiralty.[1] These were very large ships, weighing in excess of 100,000 tons (the largest of which was the Queen Elizabeth-class carrier HMS Illustrious, built at Rosyth in Scotland in 1894-1895 with a displacement of more than 1,000,000 tons), capable of carrying up to 8 aircraft at a time on a flight deck that spanned two and a half miles (3.2 km; 1¼ mi) in length. This was a far cry from the single-aisle aircraft carriers of yore, which could carry no more than a half-dozen or so aircraft in any sort of combat configuration.
